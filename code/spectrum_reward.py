"""Memory-gain reward for the blind-spectrum task.

Objective: train the model to LEARN WITH MEMORY — to recover the persistent transmitter set by
ACCUMULATING evidence across scans. The reward is the per-scan IoU of the OCCUPIED spectrum
(`SCAN_OCC`, emitted by the env against the hidden ground-truth layout); `memory_gain` (late-minus-early
occupied-IoU) is the PROOF of memory and is MEASURED, not rewarded (rewarding the gain invites
sandbagging — tanking early scans to inflate the delta).

Why OCCUPIED-IoU, not the task-native AVAILABLE-IoU (tracked as `mean_avail`): the available spectrum is
dominated by the large truly-empty region, so a memoryless agent that reports only the ~n_active current
peaks already scores ~0.47 available-IoU and memory adds only ~0.05 — too weak to train, and reporting
recalled transmitters can even hurt it. Occupied-IoU instead scores |reported_occ ∩ true_occ| / |union|:
a memoryless agent covers only n_active/total of the occupied band (~3/12 ≈ 0.25) while a full-memory
agent reaches ~1.0 — a 4x signal that REQUIRES recalling dormant transmitters. Carpeting the band is
capped (~0.5, union blows up), so accurate accumulation is the only way up. And because early scans have
seen few transmitters (low ceiling) while late scans have seen most, maximizing occupied-IoU raises LATE
scans more than EARLY — the late-minus-early gain emerges from the task structure itself.

Diagnosis that motivated this (run yysvs5nh, base qwen3-1p7b): when the model reports a transmitter it is
NEVER hallucinated (0%) — always a real current (93.9%) or recalled prior-seen (6.1%) peak. So the memory
behaviour already exists in the policy with zero precision downside; it just wasn't being PAID for under
available-IoU. Occupied-IoU pays for it directly.

    additive term: mean SCAN_ACQ = dormant coverage restricted to the YOUNGEST recallable cohort (channels
    first sighted exactly one scan ago and invisible now). mean_dorm pays for HOLDING memory and only
    indirectly for acquiring it (compound interest); the pscoc9fp census shows acquisition is the stuck
    behavior (merge-OK 41.4->43.2% while retention/read-back moved), so the merge event is paid directly at
    the first scan where it becomes verifiable. SCAN_ACQ emission scans are schedule-determined (identical
    across all 12 GRPO candidates of a row); acq targets are a subset of the dorm targets and share the
    allowed-set FP accounting, so the term adds gradient toward merging without opening any surface a
